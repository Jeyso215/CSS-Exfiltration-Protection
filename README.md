## Issues

- Like ```UBlockOrigin``` it has to stay on "Manifest v2" due to Manifest v3 limitations. See [here](https://github.com/mlgualtieri/CSS-Exfil-Protection/issues/41#issuecomment-3194432557)
- Enable ```Manifest v2``` Legacy and further support on Brave. To do this, go into ```brave://flags``` and type ```Manifest v2``` and enable the 2 options.
